## Overview

***Mastering Deep Learning*** offers a fresh perspective on learning AI. Instead of overwhelming you with dense formulas, endless theory, or superficial overviews that skip practical use, this book teaches the **fundamentals of deep learning**, **image recognition**, and **text generation** through an intuitive, hands-on approach.

It is built around three guiding principles:
- **Simplicity**: Concepts are explained as clearly and directly as possible, without unnecessary complexity.
- **Code-first learning**: Every idea comes with ready-to-run examples, so you build understanding by working through the code.
- **Expanding scope**: Starting with tensors and core fundamentals, the book gradually progresses to advanced models like WRNs and GPTs with millions of parameters.

Whether you are a student, researcher, or industry professional, this book provides the tools, examples, and explanations to help you confidently understand and apply deep learning to real-world projects. All you need is a basic foundation in math and Python to get started!
